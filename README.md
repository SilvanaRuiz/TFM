# Identification of Suicide Risk Factors in the Penitentiary Population

This repository contains the code used to analyze and generate a machine learning model based on blending techniques to classify suicide risk in Spanish prisoners. This project is part of the master's dissertation of **Silvana Ruiz Medina** for the Master's in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology.

## 📘 Project Description

Suicide risk among inmates in developed countries is substantially higher than in the general population. This study uses anonymized historical data provided by Spanish penitentiary institutions to identify predictive factors of suicidal behavior. 

The goal is to support prevention by applying machine learning techniques — from traditional models to deep learning — to detect high-risk profiles in a scalable and interpretable way.

## 🚀 Usage Workflow

Due to the academic nature of the project and data confidentiality, this code is intended for educational and research purposes only. Here's the logical workflow to run the analysis:

1. **EDA Phase** – Analyze and understand the structure and distribution of the data.
2. **Preprocessing Phase** – Concatenate, clean, and prepare data using `concat_df_*.ipynb`.
3. **Modeling Phase** – Train predictive models with `modelo_*.ipynb`.
4. **Evaluation Phase** – Evaluate and interpret model performance with `prueba_model_*.ipynb`.
